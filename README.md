Data Science Capstone Project 1


Project 1: Do fans know who the best nba players are? 

Every year from November to June, fans watch the best basketball players and teams compete for the NBA championship. The NBA is a star-driven league where fans gravitate to certain high performing players. Those players usually generate a lot of buzz on social media platforms like Twitter, and people will buy tickets just to watch that player play. The problem I want to solve is how much does the playersâ€™ performance factor into if a player is considered a star or not. In other words, do fans know who are the best players in the NBA. 



This is the code that cleans, explores, analyze, and machine learns nba performance and social media data from the 2017 NBA season


Data Cleaning:
Combined many datasets to one csv file containing important stats and social media data and removing any null values

Data exploration and analysis 
Seeing the relatiship betewwn stats that determine players performance and how performance stats relate to social media stats. There was no need to statistical/sample testing for this data set as we are working with the whole population. 


Machine Learning 
Ran random forest, regression, and KNN models to see if a model can perform well in determing a social media score based on the player's performance stats.
